    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Liam Blair, a recent Games Development graduate from Edinburgh Napier University! I am profficient with developing experiences with the Unity game engine and with C#, and I have experience with making games and simulations with C++ (SFML and Box2D for game development, OpenGL for physics-based simulations and rendering). </p>
    <p>I am currently seeking a junior or graduate position in a programming or QA role in the games development industry to initiate my career in games development, to explore my passion for developing fun and interesting games, and to gain a foothold in the industry.</p>
